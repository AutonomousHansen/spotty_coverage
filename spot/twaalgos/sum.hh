  /// \brief Sum two twa into a new twa. \a sum performs the union of the
  /// (languages of the) input automata, while \a sum_and performs their
  /// intersection.
  ///
  /// The sum is performed by adding a new initial state and a transition from
  /// this new initial states to the initial states of the arguments. \a uses an
  /// existential transition, and \a sum_and uses a universal one.
  /// The acceptance condition is the disjunction of those of the arguments.
  /// If both input automata are TGBA, the output automaton is also a TGBA,
  /// whose acceptance condition is the conjunction of the input acceptance
  /// conditions. This reduces the number of acceptance marks from
  ///   left->num_sets() + right->num_sets()
  /// to
  ///   max(left->num_sets(), right->num_sets())
  ///
  /// \a sum and \a sum_and also have a version to specify explicitely the
  /// states to be considered as initial. This is useful when considering the
  /// language recognized from a given state.
  ///
  /// \param left Left-hand-side term of the sum.
  /// \param right Right-hand-side term of the sum.
  /// \param left_state Initial state of the lhs term of the sum.
  /// \param right_state Initial state of the rhs term of the sum.
  /// \return A spot::twa_graph containing the sum of \a left and \a right.
