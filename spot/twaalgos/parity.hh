  /// \brief Change the parity acceptance of an automaton
  ///
  /// The parity acceptance condition of an automaton is characterized by
  ///    - The priority order of the acceptance sets (min or max).
  ///    - The parity of the sets seen infinitely often (odd or even).
  ///    - The number of acceptance sets.
  ///
  /// The output will be an equivalent automaton with the new parity acceptance.
  /// The automaton must have a parity acceptance. The number of acceptance sets
  /// may be increased by one. Every transition will belong to at most one
  /// acceptance set.
  ///
  /// \param aut the input parity automaton
  ///
  /// \param max whether the priority order of the acceptance sets will be max.
  ///
  /// \param odd whether the parity of the sets seen infinitely often will be
  ///            odd.
