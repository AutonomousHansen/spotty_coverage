  /// This algorithm is composed of the following steps:
  /// 2. For every states, five  of transitions are built:
  ///   - incoming transitions in the scc
  //    - outgoing transitions
  //    - self-loops
  //  3. If a mark is common to all the incoming transitions of a state, this
  //  mark is propagated to all the outgoing transitions of this state.
  //  4. If a mark is common to all the outgoing transitions of a state, this
  //  mark is propagated to all the incoming transitions of this state.
  //  5. If a state has no outgoing transitions, all the marks on self-loops
  //  can be propagated to incoming transitions
  //  6. If a state has no incoming transitions, all the marks on self-loops
  //  can be propagated to outgoing transitions
  //  7. Redo the steps 2-6 until a fixpoint is found.
