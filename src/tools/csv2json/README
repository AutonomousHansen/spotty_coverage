This directory contains a script to convert csv file into json.

====================
 QUICK INSTRUCTIONS
====================

The script 'csv2json.py' requires python3 to be installed.
It prints a json output of your csv file.

To run it, you have to define which columns are inputs in your csv file.
It is done thanks to the -i flag, followed by the inputs that
should be separated by commas.

You can define the inputs by using their position in the csv file,
or by writing them literally.

For example,
    ./csv2json.py -i model,tool,formula xxx.csv
    ./csv2json.py -i 0,1,2 xxx.csv
    ./csv2json.py -i 0,tool,2 xxx.csv
are equivalent.

===================
 Filter the inputs
===================

It is possible to keep only certain elements in the inputs.
You can write the items you want to keep, or write the items
you want to remove, and that for each input.
Write them inside brackets if you want to keep them, or inside
braces if you want to remove them.
You don't have to use a separator.

For example:
    ./csv2json.py -i tool[Cou/SE],formula xxx.csv
    ./csv2json.py -i tool{Cou/SE},formula xxx.csv
    ./csv2json.py -i tool{Cou},model[at_4/telephony_2],formula
    ./csv2json.py -i tool[CouSE],formula xxx.csv
    ./csv2json.py -i tool,model[at_4telephony_3],formula
    ./csv2json.py -i tool[OWCTY],model{at_4telephony_3},formula{F001}
