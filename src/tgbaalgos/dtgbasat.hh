  /// \param a the TGBA to reduce.  It should have only one acceptance
  ///  set and be deterministic.  I.e., it should be a deterministic TBA.
  ///
  /// \param cand_nacc is the number of acceptance sets in the result.
  ///
  /// \param state_based set to true to force all outgoing transitions
  /// of a state to share the same acceptance conditions, effectively
  /// turning the TGBA into a TBA.
  ///
  /// \param target_state_number the expected number of states wanted
  /// in the resulting automaton.  If \a target_state_number is left
  /// to its default value of -1, this function will attempt to build
  /// the smallest possible deterministic TGBA is can produce.
  ///
  /// This functions attempts to find a TGBA with \a cand_nacc
  /// acceptance sets and target_state_number states that is
  /// equivalent to \a a.  If no such TGBA is found, a null pointer is
  /// returned.
