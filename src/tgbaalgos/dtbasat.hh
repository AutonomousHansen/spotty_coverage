  /// \param a the TGBA to reduce.  It should have only one acceptance
  ///  set and be deterministic.  I.e., it should be a deterministic TBA.
  ///
  /// \param target_state_number the expected number of states wanted
  /// in the resulting automaton.  If \a target_state_number is left
  /// to its default value of -1, this function will attempt to build
  /// the smallest possible deterministic TBA is can produce.
  ///
  /// \param state_based set to true to force all outgoing transitions
  /// of a state to share the same acceptance condition, effectively
  /// turning the TBA into a BA.
  ///
  /// If no automaton with \a target_state_number states is found, or
  /// (in case <code>target_state_number == -1</code>) if no smaller
  /// automaton is found, then a null pointer is returned.
