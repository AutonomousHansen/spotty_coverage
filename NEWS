New in spot 0.0f (2003-08-01):

  * More python bindings, still only for the spot::ltl:: namespace.
  * Functional GSPN interface.  (Enable with --with-gspn=directory.)
  * The LTL scanner recognizes /\, \/, and xor.
  * Upgrade to lbtt 1.0.2.
  * tgba_tba_proxy is an on-the-fly degeneralizer.
  * Implements the "magic search" algorithm.  
    (Works only on a tgba_tba_proxy.)
  * Tgba's output algorithms (save(), dotty()) now non-recursive.
  * During products, succ_iter will optimize its set of successors
    using information computed from the current product state.
  * BDD dictionnaries are now shared between automata and.  This
    gets rid of all the BDD-variable translating machinery.

New in spot 0.0d (2003-07-13):

  * Optimize translation of G operators occurring at the root
    of a formula (or its immediate children when the root is a
    conjunction).  This saves two BDD variables per G operator.
  * Distribute lbtt, and run it during `make check'.
  * First sketch of GSPN interface.
  * succ_iter_concreate::next() completely rewritten.
  * Transitions are now labelled by boolean formulae (not only
    conjunctions).
  * Documentation:
    - Output collaboration diagrams.
    - Build and distribute PDF manual.
  * Many bug fixes.

New in spot 0.0b (2003-06-26):

  * Everything.
