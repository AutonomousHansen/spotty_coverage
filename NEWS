New in spot 0.0v (2004-06-29):

  * LTL formula simplifications using basic rewriting rules,
    a-la Wring syntactic approximations, and Etessami's universal
    and existential classes.
     - Function reduce() in ltlvisit/reduce.hh is the main interface.
     - Can be tested with the CGI script.
  * TGBA simplifications using direct simulation, delayed simulation,
    and SCC-based simplifications.  This is still experimental.
  * The LTL parser will now read LTL formulae written using Wring's syntax.
  * ltl2tgba_fm() now has options for on-the-fly fair-loop approximations,
    and Modella-like branching-postponement.
  * GreatSPN interface:
     - The `declarative_environment' is now part of Spot itself rather than
       part of the interface with GreatSPN.
     - the RG and SRG interface can deal with dead markings in three
       ways (omit deadlocks from the state graph, stutter on the deadlock
       and consider as a regular behavior, or stutter and distinguish the
       deadlock with a property).
     - update SSP interface to Soheib Baarir latest work.
  * Preliminary Python bindings for BuDDy's FDD and BVEC.
  * Upgrade to BuDDy 2.3.

New in spot 0.0t (2004-04-23):

  * `emptiness_check':
      - fix two bugs in the computation of the counter example,
      - revamp the interface for better customization.
  * `never_claim_reachable': new function.
  * Introduce annonymous BDD variables in `bdd_dict', and start
    to use it in `ltl_to_tgba_fm'.
  * Offer never claim in the CGI script.
  * Rename EESRG as SSP, and offer specialized variants of the
    emptiness_check.

New in spot 0.0r (2004-03-08):

  * In ltl_to_tgba_fm:
    - New option `exprop' to optimize determinism.
    - Make the `symbolic indentification' from 0.0p optional.
  * `nonacceptant_lbtt_reachable' new function to help getting
    accurate statistics from LBTT.
  * Revamp the cgi script's user interface.
  * Upgrade to lbtt 1.0.3, swig 1.3.21, automake 1.8.3

New in spot 0.0p (2004-02-03):

  * In ltl_to_tgba_fm:
    - identify states with identical symbolic expansions
      (i.e., identical continuations)
    - use Acc[b] as acceptance condition for Fb, not Acc[Fb].
  * Update and speed-up the cgi script.
  * Improve degeneralization.

New in spot 0.0n (2004-01-13):

  * emptiness_check::check2() is a variant of Couvreur's emptiness check that
    explores visited states first.
  * Build the EESRG supporting code condinally, as the associated
    GreatSPN changes have not yet been contributed to GreatSPN.
  * Add a powerset algorithm (determinize TGBA ignoring acceptance
    conditions, i.e., as if they were used to recognize finite languages).
  * tgba_explicit::merge_transitions: merge transitions with same source,
    destination, and acceptance condition.
  * Run test cases within valgrind.
  * Various bug fixes.

New in spot 0.0l (2003-12-01):

  * Computation of prime implicants.  This simplify the output of
    ltl_to_tgba_fm, and allows conditions to be output as some of
    product in dot output.
  * Optimize translation of GFy in ltl_to_tgba_fm.
  * tgba_explicit supports arbitrary binary formulae on transitions
    (only conjunctions were allowed).

New in spot 0.0j (2003-11-03):

  * Use hash_map's instead of map's almost everywhere.
  * New emptiness check, based on Couvreur's algorithm.
  * LTL propositions can be put inside doublequotes to disambiguate
    some constructions.
  * Preliminary support for GreatSPN's EESRG.
  * Various bug fixes.

New in spot 0.0h (2003-08-18):

  * More python bindings:
    - "import buddy" works (see wrap/python/tests/bddnqueen.py for an example),
    - almost all the Spot API is now available via "import spot".
  * wrap/python/cgi/ltl2tgba.py is an LTL-to-Büchi translator that
    work as as a cgi script.
  * Couvreur's FM'99 ltl-to-tgba translation.

New in spot 0.0f (2003-08-01):

  * More python bindings, still only for the spot::ltl:: namespace.
  * Functional GSPN interface.  (Enable with --with-gspn=directory.)
  * The LTL scanner recognizes /\, \/, and xor.
  * Upgrade to lbtt 1.0.2.
  * tgba_tba_proxy is an on-the-fly degeneralizer.
  * Implements the "magic search" algorithm.
    (Works only on a tgba_tba_proxy.)
  * Tgba's output algorithms (save(), dotty()) now non-recursive.
  * During products, succ_iter will optimize its set of successors
    using information computed from the current product state.
  * BDD dictionnaries are now shared between automata and.  This
    gets rid of all the BDD-variable translating machinery.

New in spot 0.0d (2003-07-13):

  * Optimize translation of G operators occurring at the root
    of a formula (or its immediate children when the root is a
    conjunction).  This saves two BDD variables per G operator.
  * Distribute lbtt, and run it during `make check'.
  * First sketch of GSPN interface.
  * succ_iter_concreate::next() completely rewritten.
  * Transitions are now labelled by boolean formulae (not only
    conjunctions).
  * Documentation:
    - Output collaboration diagrams.
    - Build and distribute PDF manual.
  * Many bug fixes.

New in spot 0.0b (2003-06-26):

  * Everything.
