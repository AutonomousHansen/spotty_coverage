This benchmark measures the performance of different algorithms to
check if a formula belongs to the persistence or the recurrence class.

To reproduce the benchmark, execute the following commands;

export SPOT_BENCH_PRCHECK="/path/to/spot/root/folder"
./prcheck_bench.sh

This should create 6 files:

  - patterns:
      A list of literature formula.
  - random:
      A list of random formula.
  - {kind}.{class}.csv:
      A resulting file where kind is either patterns or random and class
      is either persistence or recurrence.
