This benchmark was used in the FORTE'14 paper "Mechanizing the
Minimization of Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata", by
Souheib Baarir and Alexandre Duret-Lutz.  The generated data
used in the paper are at

  https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/forte14/

Note that the encoding used in the SAT-based minimization have evolved
since the paper, so if you want to reproduce exactly the benchmark
from the paper, you should download a copy of Spot 1.2.3.


To reproduce, follow these instructions:

1) Compile Spot and install if it is not already done.

2) Compile Glucose 3 from http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/
   and make sure the 'glucose' binary is in your PATH.

3) Compile ltl2dstar from http://www.ltl2dstar.de/ and
   make sure the 'ltl2dstar' binary is in your path.

4) Compile DBAminimizer from
   http://www.react.uni-saarland.de/tools/dbaminimizer

   and define the path to minimize.py with

   % export DBA_MINIMIZER=$HOME/dbaminimizer/minimize.py

5) Then make sure you are in this directory:

   % cd bench/dtgbasat/

6) Classify the set of formulas with

   % ./prepare.sh

   This will read the formulas from file "formulas" and output a file
   "info.ltl", in which each formula is associated to a class (the ①,
   ②, ③, and ④ of the paper), and a number of acceptance conditions
   (the "m" of the paper).

7) Build a makefile to run all experiments

   % ./stats.sh

8) You may optionally change the directory that contains temporary
    files with

   % export TMPDIR=someplace

   (These temporary files can be several GB large.)

   Note that runtime will be limited to 2h, but memory is not bounded.
   You should set such a limit with "ulimit" if you like.  For instance
   % ulimit -v 41943040

9) Actually run all experiments

   % make -j4 -f stat.mk

   This will build a CSV file called "all.csv".

10) You may generate LaTeX code for the tables with the scripts:
   - tabl.pl: Full data.
   - tabl1.pl, tabl2.pl, tabl3.pl, tabl4.pl: Partial tables as shown
   in the paper.

   All these script takes the CSV file all.csv as first argument, and
   output LaTeX to their standard output.
