* models/cl3serv1.pml
* models/cl3serv3.pml

    Two simple client/server promela examples.

* models/clserv.ltl

    Variations of the leader election protocol with extinction from
    Tel, Introduction to Distributed Algorithms, 1994, Chapter 7. The
    network in the model consists of three nodes. In Variant 1, the
    same node wins every time, in Variant 2, each node gets a turn at
    winning the election.  These specifications were originally
    distributed alongside

* pml2tgba.pl

    A Perl script to translate Promela models into TGBA readble by Spot.
    This requires a working spin in PATH.

* ltl-random.sh

    Use all emptiness-check algorithms to test random graphs against
    random LTL formulae.

* ltl-human.sh

    Use all emptiness-check algorithms to test random graphs against
    all the formulae of the file `formulae.ltl'

* pml-clserv.sh

    Check the two configurations of the client/server example against
    the formula in models/clserv.ltl, without and with fairness
    assumptions, using all the algorithms of the file `algorihms'.
    You should have run `make' before attempting to run this script,
    so the state space are available.

* pml-eeaean.sh

    Check models/eeaean1.pml and models/eeaean2.pml against each
    formulae in models/eeaean.ltl, using all the algorithms of the
    file `algorihms'.  You should have run `make' before attempting to
    run this script, so the state space are available.


=======
 USAGE
=======

  0. Install SPIN (spinroot.com), and make sure the `spin' binary is in
     your path.

  1. If that is not done already, configure and compile all the Spot
     library, then come back into this directory.

  2. Run `make' in this directory.  This will call pml2tgba.pl to
     generate the TGBA input for the two pml-*.sh tests.

  3. Run the tests you are interested in

     - ltl-random.sh
     - ltl-human.sh
     - pml-clserv.sh
     - pml-eeaean.sh

     Beware that the two ltl-*.sh tests are very long (each of them
     run 13 emptiness-check algorithms against 18000 product-spaces!).
     Running ltl-random.sh took 4 hours on a 3GHz Intel Pentium 4,
     and ltl-human.sh took 9 hours.

     You can speed up the pml-*.sh tests by removing some algorithms
     from the `algorithms' file.

==========================
 INTERPRETING THE RESULTS
==========================

  Here are the short names for the algorithms used in the outputs.

    Cou99
    Cou99_shy-
    Cou99_shy
  > Cou99_rem
  > Cou99_rem_shy-
  > Cou99_rem_shy
  > CVWY90
    CVWY90_bsh
  > GV04
  > SE05
    SE05_bsh
  > Tau03
  > Tau03_opt

  Only the algorithms marked with a `>' have been shown in the paper.
  `bsh' stands for `bit-state hashing'.

  `Cou99_rem*' algorithms are using the `rem' field to remove
  the SCC without recomputing the SCC as described in the paper.
  The other `Cou99*' algorithms are not.  (Beware that in the paper
  we showed the `Cou99_rem*' variants and called them `Cou99*'.)


  The ltl-*.sh tests output look as follows:

=================
 MORE STATISTICS
=================

  The ltl-*.sh tests use src/tgbatest/randtgba to output statistics,
  but randtgba is able to output a lot more data than what we have
  shown above.  Try removing the `-1' option from the script, or toying
  with randtgba itself.

  Besides randtgba, two other tools that you might find handy we
  experimenting are src/ltltest/randltl and src/tgbatest/ltl2tgba.
