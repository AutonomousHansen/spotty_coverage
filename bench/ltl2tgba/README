This directory contains benchmark scripts for LTL-to-Büchi translators.
They are all based on lbtt.

* algorithms

  The lbtt configuration of all the algorithms.  More about these below.

* small
* big
* known

  Run lbtt on, respectively:
    small formulae (size 10, 4 propositions)
    big formulae (size 12..15, 8 propositions)
    known formulae (96 formulae from formulae.ltl)

  Each script generates 3 files:
    xxxx.cfg: the configuration file for lbtt
    xxxx.log: the log of lbtt's execution (also output when the script runs)
    xxxx.txt: the sumary of the test (also output at the end of the script)

* ltl2baw.in
* ltl2baw.pl

  ltl2baw.pl is generated from ltl2baw.in by configure.  This perl
  script converts the intermediate generalized automata computed by
  ltl2ba into a form usable by lbtt.

* formulae.ltl

  A list of LTL formulae used by the `known' check.
  See ../emptchk/README for the sources.

* parseout.pl

  This scripts is used to create *.txt files from *.log files.


====================
 ALGORITHMS & TOOLS
====================

The page http://spot.lip6.fr/wiki/LtlTranslationBenchmark explains
all the keys used and the different tools involved in the benchmark.

Spot's configure script checks for the tools needed in the
benchmark, and the script in this directory should omit the tools
that are not available.


=======================
 Reading the summaries
=======================

The files small.txt, big.txt, and known.txt contain a summary of the
results.  Each algorithm is described as two lines formated as
follows.

   18: FM, gen, +symb_merge, -exprop, LTLopt
            494 /    975 /  100 /      4.25       98798 /   3935920   (100)

The first line presents the name of the algorithm ("FM, gen,
+symb_merge, -exprop, LTLopt") and its number for lbtt (18).
The number is useless.  See http://spot.lip6.fr/wiki/LtlTranslationBenchmark
for the naming conventions.

The second line display 7 values:
  1. the total number of states of all generated automata (494)
  2. the total number of transitions of all generated automata (975)
  3. the total number of acceptance conditions of all generated automata (100)
  4. the cumulated translation time in seconds (4.25)
  5. the total number of states in the synchronized products (98798)
  6. the total number of transitions in the synchronized products (3935920)
  7. the number of translated automata (100)

Notes:

  * Small translation times are not accurate because most of the translators
    are run through scripts that translate their input from and their ouput to
    the format understood by lbtt.  For fast translators, most of the time
    is spent through these wrappers.  (For instance Spot's ltl2tgba is
    run through lbtt-translate, and depending on how Spot has been configured
    w.r.t. to dynamic libraries, ltl2tgba itself is often a shell script that
    run the real binary with the locally built libraries.)

  * Some tools will appear to have translated fewer automata than the
    others.  This normally indicates bugs in the translator.  In that
    case it is harder to compare the results.  (Normalizing the other
    values accordingly may not be fair: maybe the translator precisely
    failed to translate the largest automata.)
