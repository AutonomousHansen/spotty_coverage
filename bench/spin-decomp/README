This directory contains the input files and scripts used to produce
the measures for dynamic algorithms this bench is a part of the

 CONTENTS
==========

* allbenchs.txt

    The set of model formula and results of this bench. This is used to
    check the consistency and generate the benchmark

* construct_benchs.sh

    This script generate the bench from the formula and generate for
    each formula 4 neverclaims: one for the original ltl property
    and 3 for decomposition. Note that the name of atomic propositions
    are also rewritten to please spin. It could take a while!

* spin_bench.sh

    This is the main tool to launch the bench.

    This is the promela models for the bench

 USAGE
==========

  1. If that is not done already, configure and compile all the Spot
     library, then come back into this directory.

  2. Run construct_bench.sh to construct the benchmark

  3. Run spin_bench.sh to launch the benchmark, std::cout should not
     contain ERROR messages


==========================
 INTERPRETING THE RESULTS
==========================

  Results are stored into properties-res
