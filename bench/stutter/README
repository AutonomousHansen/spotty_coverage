This benchmark measures the performance of different algorithms to
check if property (expressed as a formula or as a deterministic TGBA)
is stutter-invariant.  When the benchmark is run on formulas, the
translation time is not included in the measured time.


To reproduce the benchmark is to run

  % ./stutter_bench.sh -j8

to create bench_formulas.csv and bench_randgraph.csv.
(Adjust -j8 to the number of cores you have.)

Then explore these data the provided ipython notebook

  % ipython notebook --pylab=inline stutter.ipynb


The time in bench_formulas.csv is reported in microseconds, while the
time in bench_randgraph.csv is in seconds.
