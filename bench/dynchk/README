* models/cl3serv1.pml
* models/cl3serv3.pml

    Two simple client server models

* models/eeaean1.pml
* models/eeaean2.pml

    Variations of the leader election protocol with extinction from
    Tel, Introduction to Distributed Algorithms, 1994, Chapter 7. The
    network in the model consists of three nodes. In Variant 1, the
    same node wins every time, in Variant 2, each node gets a turn at
    winning the election.  These specifications were originally
    distributed alongside

* models/eeaean1.test_suite
* models/eeaean2.test_suite

    Formula to check over the two previous algorithms 

* algorithms

    Various algorithms 

* dynchk.cc

    The tool used to perform benchs. 
    It can be used to run a simple bench using ./dynchk model file|formula

* generator.sh

    A tool alowing to produce commuting formula

* pml2tgba.pl

    A Perl script to translate Promela models into TGBA readable by Spot.
    This requires a working spin in PATH.

* test_suite.sh

   The main script to launch to run all benchs for commuting formula 
   with an LaTeX  output

 USAGE
==========

  1. If that is not done already, configure and compile all the Spot
     library, then come back into this directory.

  2. Run `make' in this directory.  This will call pml2tgba.pl to
     generate the TGBA input for the two pml-*.sh tests.

     Promela inputs are translated in 4 different graphs.
     For instance eeaean1.pml is translated as
       - eeaean1.tgba        full translation
       - eeaean1fair.tgba    full translation with weak fairness
       - eeaean1R.tgba       reduced translation
       - eeaean1Rfair.tgba   reduced translation with weak fairness
     The "reduced" translation uses Spin's partial order reductions.

     (The "R"educed variants are not shown in the paper.)

  3. Run test_suite.sh
